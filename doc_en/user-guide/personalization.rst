Personalization
===============

CKAN provides features to personalize the experience of both searching for and
publishing data. You must be logged in to use these features.

.. _managing_your_news_feed:

Managing your news feed
-----------------------

At the top of any page, select the dashboard symbol (next to your name). CKAN
displays your News feed. This shows changes to datasets that you follow, and
any changed or new datasets in projects that you follow. The number by the
dashboard symbol shows the number of new notifications in your News feed since
you last looked at it. As well as datasets and projects, it is possible to
follow individual users (to be notified of changes that they make to datasets).

If you want to stop following a dataset (or project or user), go to the
dataset's page (e.g. by selecting a link to it in your News feed) and select
the "Unfollow" button.

.. _managing_profile:

Managing your user profile
--------------------------

You can change the information that CKAN holds about you, including what other
users see about you by editing your user profile. (Users are most likely to see
your profile when you edit a dataset or upload data to a project that
they are following.) To do this, select the gearwheel symbol at the top of any
page.

CKAN displays the user settings page. Here you can change:

* Your username

* Your full name

* Your e-mail address (note: this is not displayed to other users)

* Your profile text - an optional short paragraph about yourself

* Your password

Make the changes you require and then select the "Update Profile" button.

.. note::

    If you change your username, CKAN will log you out. You will need to log
    back in using your new username.
