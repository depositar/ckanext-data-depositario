"|site_name|" is a public platform for storing, preserving, managing, and exploring research data. |site_name| is built with `CKAN <http://ckan.org>`_, which is an open source data management system, and extended with many useful features. The site is located at https://data.depositar.io.

This user guide covers using CKAN's web interface to organize, publish and find
data. CKAN also has a powerful API (machine interface), which makes it easy to
develop extensions and links with other information systems. The API is
documented in http://docs.ckan.org/en/2.7/api/index.html.

Some web UI features relating to site administration are available only to
users with sysadmin status, and are documented in http://docs.ckan.org/en/2.7/sysadmin-guide.html.
