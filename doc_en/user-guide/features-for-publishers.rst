.. _adding_a_new_dataset:

Adding a new dataset
--------------------

.. note::

   You may need an user account in order to add and edit datasets.

**Step 1**. You can access CKAN's "Create dataset" screen in two ways.

a) Select the "Datasets" link at the top of any page. From this, above the
   search box, select the "Add Dataset" button.

b) Alternatively, select the "projects" link at the top of a page. Now
   select the page for the project that should own your new dataset. Provided
   that you are a member of this project, you can now select the "Add
   Dataset" button above the search box.

**Step 2**. CKAN will ask for the information about your data (See :ref:`dataset_fields`).

.. image:: /images/add_dataset_1.png

.. note::

    By default, the only required field on this page is the title. However, it
    is good practice to include, at the minimum, a short description and, if
    possible, the license information. You should ensure that you choose the
    correct project for the dataset, since at present, this cannot be changed
    later. You can edit or add to the other fields later.

**Step 3**. When you have filled in the information on this page, select the "Next: Add
Data" button. (Alternatively select "Cancel" to discard the information filled
in.)

.. _add_resource:

**Step 4**. CKAN will display the "Add data" screen.

  .. image:: /images/add_dataset_2.png

This is where you will add one or more "resources" which contain the data for
this dataset. Choose a file or link for your data resource and select the
appropriate choice at the top of the screen:

* If you are giving CKAN a link to the data, like
  ``http://example.com/mydata.csv``, then select "Link to a file" or "Link to an
  API". (If you don't know what an API is, you don't need to worry about this
  option - select "Link to a file".)

* If the data to be added to CKAN is in a file on your computer, select "Upload
  a file". CKAN will give you a file browser to select it.

**Step 5**. Add the other information on the page. (Please refer to :ref:`resource_fields`)
CKAN does not require this information, but it is good practice to add it.

**Step 6**. If you have more resources (files or links) to add to the dataset, select
the "Save & add another" button. When you have finished adding resources,
select "Next: Additional Info".

**Step 7**. Select the 'Finish' button. CKAN creates the dataset and shows you
the result. You have finished!

You should be able to find your dataset by typing the title, or some relevant
words from the description, into the search box on any page in your CKAN
instance. For more information about finding data, see the section
:doc:`finding-data`.

.. _adding_a_dataset_to_topic:

Extended feature — Add a dataset to an existing topic
-----------------------------------------------------

The topic is different from "Projects" feature as the latter is the way to control the visibility of datasets in CKAN and each dataset can belong to ONLY ONE project.

We refer to the `Wikipedia's categories <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Categories>`_
to define the following topics:

* General reference
* Culture and the arts
* Geography and places

Before adding a dataset to a theme, you should complete the upload process of the dataset (listed on the :ref:`adding_a_new_dataset`). Then do the following steps:

* Go to the dataset's page. You can find it by entering the title in the search box on any page.

* Select the "Topics" tab in the dataset's page.

    .. image:: /images/add_topic_1.png

+ Select an existing topic and select the "Add to topic" button.

.. _UI_editing_extend:

Extended feature — Fill-in snippet
----------------------------------

.. _UI_editing_extend_time:

* **Temporal Information (Time Period of Dataset)**

The "temporal information" here means the time to events related to the dataset, not the time when
the resources in the dataset were created.

  * *Temporal Resolution* -- This refers to the precision of a measurement with respect to time.
    It can be the minimal time interval between subsequent examinations, or the maximum time error
    when the time period is uncertain.

  * *Start and End Time* -- This refers the beginning and end time of the time period.
    Acceptable formats: "YYYY", "YYYY-MM", or "YYYY-MM-DD".

.. image:: /images/temporal_info.png

.. _UI_editing_extend_spatial:

* **Spatial Information**

Here you can specify the spatial extent of the dataset for indexing, then the dataset can
be found through :ref:`spatial search <spatial_search>`.

You can use the following two methods to generate a valid spatial extent in GeoJSON format:

  * *Using a Map* -- You can also add the spatial extent through digitizing process.
    Select the "Use a map to fill in spatial coverage" button and draw a polyline, polygon,
    rectangle, or marker on the expanded map to generate the spatial extent.

  * *Convert from Parcel Corner* -- If you already have the longitude and latitude of the corners
    for the parcel to describe the dataset, you can fill in the X.min, X.max, Y.mim, and Y.max
    fields, then select the "Use parcel corners to fill in spatial coverage" button to generate
    the spatial extent.

You can also fill in the spatial resolution of the dataset here.

.. image:: /images/spatial_info.png

* **Auto-completion of management metadata**

You can use the "Use your account information to fill in contact person's name and email" button
to automatically fill in the contact person's information (``Contact Person`` and ``Contact Person Email``)
using your account information (for account information, please refer to :ref:`managing_profile`).

.. image:: /images/profile_input.png

.. _editing-a-dataset:

Editing a dataset
-----------------

You can edit the dataset you have created, or any dataset owned by an
project that you are a member of. (If a dataset is not owned by any
project, then any registered user can edit it.)

#. Go to the dataset's page. You can find it by entering the title in the search box on any page.

#. Select the "Edit" button, which you should see above the dataset title.

#. CKAN displays the "Edit dataset" screen. You can edit any of the fields
   (Title, Description, Dataset, etc), change the visibility (Private/Public), and
   add or delete tags or custom fields. For details of these fields, see
   :ref:`adding_a_new_dataset`.

#. When you have finished, select the "Update dataset" button to save your changes.

.. image:: /images/edit_dataset.png

.. _dataset_collaborators:

Dataset collaborators
---------------------

In addition to traditional project-based permissions, CKAN instances can also enable
the dataset collaborators feature, which allows dataset-level authorization. This provides
more granular control over who can access and modify datasets that belong to a project,
or allows authorization setups not based on projects.

You can manage dataset collaborators through the "Collaborators" tab in the "Edit dataset" page.

By default, only Administrators of the project a dataset belongs to can add collaborators
to a dataset. When adding them, they can choose between two roles: member and editor.

A **member** can:

* View the dataset if it is private.

An **editor** can do everything a **member** can plus:

* Make the dataset public or private.
* Edit or delete the dataset (including assigning it to a project).

Adding, deleting and editing resources
--------------------------------------

#. Go to the dataset's "Edit dataset" page (steps 1-2 above).

#. In the left sidebar, there are options for editing resources. You can select
   an existing resource (to edit or delete it), or select "Add new resource".

#. You can edit the information about the resource or change the linked or
   uploaded file. For details, see steps 4-5 of "Adding a new resource", above.

#. When you have finished editing, select the button marked "Update resource"
   (or "Add", for a new resource) to save your changes. Alternatively, to delete
   the resource, select the "Delete resource" button.


Deleting a dataset
------------------

#. Go to the dataset's "Edit dataset" page (see "Editing a dataset", above).

#. Select the "Delete" button.

#. CKAN displays a confirmation dialog box. To complete deletion of the
   dataset, select "Confirm".

.. note::

    The "Deleted" dataset is not completely deleted. It is hidden, so it does
    not show up in any searches, etc. However, by visiting the URL for the
    dataset's page, it can still be seen (by users with appropriate authorization),
    and "undeleted" if necessary. If it is important to completely delete the
    dataset, contact your site administrator.


.. _creating_an_project:

Creating a project
------------------

In general, each dataset is owned by one project. Each project
includes certain users, who can modify its datasets and create new ones.
Different levels of access privileges within a project can be given to
users, e.g. some users might be able to edit datasets but not create new ones,
or to create datasets but not publish them. Each project has a home page,
where users can find some information about the project and search within
its datasets. This allows different data publishing departments, bodies, etc to
control their own publishing policies.

To create a project:

#. Select the "Projects" link at the top of any page.

#. Select the "Add Project" button below the search box.

#. CKAN displays the "Create a Project" page.

#. Enter a name for the project, and, optionally, a description and image
   URL for the project's home page.

#. Select the "Create Project" button. CKAN creates your project and
   displays its home page. Initially, of course, the project has no datasets.

.. image:: /images/create_project.png

You can now change the access privileges to the project for other users -
see :ref:`managing_an_project` below. You can also create datasets owned by the
project; see :ref:`adding_a_new_dataset` above.

.. note::

    You can learn how to fill in the information above by referring to
    :site_url:`existing projects <organization>`.
    And, depending on how CKAN is set up, you may not be authorized to create new
    projects. In this case, if you need a new project, you will need to
    contact your site administrator.


.. _managing_an_project:

Managing a project
------------------

When you create a project, CKAN automatically makes you its "Admin".
From the project's page you should see an "Admin" button above the search
box. When you select this, CKAN displays the project admin page. This page
has two tabs:

* *Info* -- Here you can edit the information supplied when the project
  was created (title, description and image).

* *Members* -- Here you can add, remove and change access roles for different
  users in the project. Note: you will need to know their username on CKAN.

.. image:: /images/manage_project.png

By default CKAN allows members of projects with three roles:

* *Member* -- can see the project's private datasets

* *Editor* -- can edit and publish datasets

* *Admin* -- can add, remove and change roles for project members

Inviting others to project
--------------------------

If you want to invite others to collaborate on datasets, you can invite them to your project.
From the project’s page you should see an “Admin” button above the search box.
When you select this, CKAN displays the project admin page.

Select the "Members" tab, and you will see the project members page.
Then select the "Add Member" button.

.. image:: /images/invite_user.png

You can invite an user to your project by his/her username in the "Existing User" section.
Or you can invite a new user via email.
