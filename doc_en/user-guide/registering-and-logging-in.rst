Registering and logging in
==========================

.. note::

    Registration is needed for most publishing features and for personalization
    features, such as "following" datasets. It is not needed to search for and
    download data.

.. hint::

   We provide a demo system at https://demo.depositar.io with the same features
   as |site_name| for evaluation purposes. You can create an account and try
   any functions provided by |site_name|. Please note that all data in this instance
   will be deleted occasionally.

To create a user ID, use the "Register" link at the top of any page. CKAN will
ask for the following:

* *Username* -- choose a username using only letters, numbers, - and _ characters.
  For example, "jbloggs" or "joe_bloggs93".

* *Full name* -- to be displayed on your user profile

* *E-mail address* -- this will not be visible to other users

If there are problems with any of the fields, CKAN will tell you the problem
and enable you to correct it. When the fields are filled in correctly, we will receive an
email to set your password as follows.
Then you can use the "Log in" link at the top of any page to log in.

.. parsed-literal::

   Dear OOO,

   Please click the following link to confirm this request:

   Have a nice day.
